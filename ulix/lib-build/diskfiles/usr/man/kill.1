KILL(1)                   ULIX General Commands Manual                 KILL(1)

NAME
     kill -- terminate or signal a process

SYNOPSIS
     kill [-signal_number] pid

DESCRIPTION
     The kill utility sends a signal to the process specified by the pid op-
     erand(s).  Only the super-user may send signals to other users' proces-
     ses. The options are as follows:

     -signal_number
             A non-negative decimal integer, specifying the signal to be sent
             instead of the default TERM.

     Some of the more commonly used signals:
     9       KILL (non-catchable, non-ignorable kill)
     15      TERM (software termination signal)

NOTES
     This is a shortened version of the kill manpage from Mac OS X.
